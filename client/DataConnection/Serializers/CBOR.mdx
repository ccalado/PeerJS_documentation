Starting with version **1.5**, PeerJS supports [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) encoding for messages. Have a look at [this page](overview.mdx) for a comparison of the different serializers.

CBOR:

- supports [Streams](../Streams.mdx)
- is an official IETF standard ([RFC 8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949))
- is much faster than both JSON and BinaryPack
- is highly extensible (custom types can be defined)
- supports chunking of large messages
- is supported by all major browsers

As the encoding/decoding behaviour is sometimes subtly different from the default BinaryPack encoding, it is opt-in.

<TabItem value="import" label={"NPM"}>

```ts
import { CborPeer } from "peerjs";

const peer = new CborPeer();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="classic" label={"Global"}>

```ts
const { Cbor } = await import(
	"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/peerjs@1.5.0/dist/serializer.cbor.mjs"
);

const peer = new Peer({
	serializers: { Cbor, default: Cbor },
});
