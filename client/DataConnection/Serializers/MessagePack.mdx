Starting with version **1.5**, PeerJS supports [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) encoding for messages.
Have a look at [this page](overview.mdx) for a comparison of the different serializers.

Cbor:

- supports [Streams](../Streams.mdx)
- is much faster than both JSON and BinaryPack
- is highly extensible (custom types can be defined)
- supports chunking of large messages
- is supported by all major browsers

As the encoding/decoding behaviour is sometimes subtly different from the default BinaryPack encoding, it is opt-in.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="import" label={"NPM"}>

```ts
import { MsgPackPeer } from "peerjs";

const peer = new MsgPackPeer();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="classic" label={"Global"}>

```ts
const { MsgPack } = await import(
	"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/peerjs@1.5.0/dist/serializer.msgpack.mjs"
);

const peer = new Peer({
	serializers: { MsgPack, default: MsgPack },
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
